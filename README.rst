This works only on linux atm.

Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Install those programs with your system package manager or download them from developers
directly. If you chose the second option, remember to include directories with binaries
of the programs in the `PATH <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PATH_(variable)>`_ variable.


You must use ``python3.9`` or higher. (Binary in release section should be independent from your python version).

- `mpv <https://mpv.io/installation>`_
- `youtube-dl <https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl#installation>`_
- `tcpdump <https://www.tcpdump.org/#latest-releases>`_

  OR
- `tcpflow <https://github.com/simsong/tcpflow>`_

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Requirements installation example for
`apt <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/APT_(Package_Manager)>`_:

::

    apt update && apt install mpv youtube-dl tcpdump

Requirements installation example for
`pacman <https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Pacman>`_:

::

    pacman -S mpv youtube-dl tcpdump

Installing the main program:


Try using binary in the releases section, if that doesn't work, go with the instructions below:

::

    pip3 install https://github.com/szero/mouselounge/archive/master.zip

If you're using ``tcpdump``, it should be already configured and ready to use.
If it isn't the ``mouselounge`` program will error out with "[Your capture device]:
You don't have permission to capture on that device". You can assign the program
packet capturing rights by issing the command below:

::

    sudo setcap 'CAP_NET_RAW+eip CAP_NET_ADMIN+eip' "$(command -v tcpdump)"

As for ``tcpflow``, the command looks like this this.

::

    sudo setcap 'CAP_NET_RAW+eip CAP_NET_ADMIN+eip' "$(command -v tcpflow)"

If you don't like giving programs extended rights permanently you can skip the steps above
and just run ``mouselounge`` with sudo.

Usage
~~~~~

Run ``mouselounge`` in your terminal!

Thats it! Now you can paste your links inside music input box like you always did,
but now, mpv window with given video will open and information about posted youtube
videos will be printed in the termianl.

To quit, either press ``Ctrl + C`` or ``Ctrl + \``

FAQ
~~~

1. I installed the thing and all of its dependiencies, it was working for some time and
   videos still appear in the terminal window but no video window appears anymore.

- *This program depends on youtube-dl. It always changes because youtube
  changes it's API's all the time. If you can't see vids, try updating youtube-dl
  to the newest version first from the link in Installation section preferably.*
